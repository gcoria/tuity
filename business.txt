# Business Assumptions for Tuity

## Core Assumptions
- All users are valid, no signup/signin module required
- User identification via header, param, or body
- Solution must scale to millions of users
- Application optimized for read operations


### User Management
- User profiles are minimal (ID, username, display name)
- No user authentication/authorization required for MVP
- User data is eventually consistent across services

### Tweet Management
- Tweet character limit: 280 characters
- Tweet content is plain text only
- Tweet IDs are globally unique
- Tweets cannot be edited
- Tweet deletion is soft delete
- Tweets are public by default

### Follow System
- Users can follow unlimited number of other users
- No mutual follow requirement (asymmetric relationships)
- Follow/unfollow operations are idempotent
- No follow request approval system
- Self-following is not allowed

### Timeline Generation
- Default timeline limit: 20 tweets per request
- Timeline refresh frequency: real-time for active users
- Timeline caching TTL: 5 minutes

# MVP Assumptions

### Rate Limiting (MVP)
- Tweet creation: 10 tweets per minute per user
- Follow operations: 20 follows per minute per user
- Timeline requests: 100 requests per minute per user
- Rate limiting uses token bucket algorithm
- Rate limits are per user

### Timeline Generation Strategy (MVP)
- Simple push model for all users
- Timeline cache expire in 5 minutes

### Event System (MVP)
- In-memory event bus
- Asynchronous event processing
- Event types: tweet_created, user_followed, user_unfollowed


# Final Solution Assumptions

### Scalability Assumptions
- Expected user growth: 0 to 10M user
- Peak tweet rate: 10,000 tweets/second
- Peak timeline requests: 100,000 requests/second
- Celebrity users: up to 10M followers
- Average user follows: 100-200 users

### Data Consistency
- Eventually consistent on reads
- Strong consistency for follow operations
- Tweet creation must be immediately visible to author

### Monitoring & Observability
- Performance metrics tracked for all endpoints
- Error rates monitored with alerting
- Business metrics: tweets/day, follows/day, etc
